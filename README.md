# Machine-learning-project
Multiple disease prediction using machine learning algorithms : Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually changing medical practice. With recent progress in digitized data
acquisition, machine learning and computing infrastructure, AI applications are expanding into areas that were previously thought to be only the province of human experts. In this we outline recent breakthroughs in AI technologies and their biomedical applications, identify the challenges for further progress in medical AI systems, and summarize the economic, legal and social implications of AI in healthcare.
We have used Python which has an extensive and comprehensive collection of freely available packages covering a variety of topics. Scientific Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and pandas provide efficient implementation of numerical operations and tasks common in science and engineering. These libraries provide a strong base from which more advanced scientific software can be built without needing to worry about low-level algorithms. Additionally, many domain specific packages exist which address the scientific needs of the meteorological community. Also we have used Convolutional Neural Networks to classify various diseases and also some state of the art Machine Learning algorithms.
#Steps for executing the project :
1. Open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.
2. Create a virtual environment using the command:
   conda create --name env_name python=3.9
3. Activate the virtual environment with:
   conda activate env_name
4. Install Flask by running:
   pip install flask
5. Save the file in your project directory.
6. Navigate to the project directory using:
   cd path\to\your\project
7. Start the Flask application by running:
   python app.py
8. Open a browser and visit:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
9. To stop the server, press Ctrl + C in the Anaconda Prompt.
